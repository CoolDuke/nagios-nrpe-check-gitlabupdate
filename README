This is a perl script that checks for updates of GitLab intended to use with 
the Nagios NRPE daemon by comparing the installed version number with the 
latest tag in the GitLab repository. Fetching the repository is done by a
daily running cronjob, that stores the latest version in a spool file.

It uses the default pathes as used in the GitLab documentation. If you 
want to change them, you have to edit the first lines of the script.

You can create a debian package using dpkg-buildpackage in the repository
root and install it using your package manager.

The scripts needs superuser rights to run, a sudo configuration file is
included.
